        My name is Allan, my nickname “Abacate” or Avocado. In text I explain why the nickname. I’m from Brazil.<br><br>

        In 2017 I decided to do my first backpacking through South America and to record the moments I decided to buy a camera, a Fujifilm.<br>
        When I started backpacking in the first country of Bolivia to go to the Salar de Uyuni, the biggest salt desert in the world, I try shoot the first photo,<br> 
        the Photo was basically Black, so I try to understand why. I couldn't take any pictures that day and I thought the camera was broken. <br><br>

        I went looking for a video tutorial on YouTube and found out what was happening, so as I was doing nothing at the moment I decided to watch some other<br>
        videos about basic photography and understanding how a camera works. From that moment I just fell in love with photography and after that I never<br>
        stopped photographing.<br><br>

        My nickname started at school, but I'm not sure why... that's all<br><br>

        Let's talk~<br><br>
